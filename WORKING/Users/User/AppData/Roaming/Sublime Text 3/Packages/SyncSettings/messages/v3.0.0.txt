Sync Settings v3.0.0

I am happy to announce a new version of Sync Settings.
This version includes a lot of improvements and bug fixes

In the previous version of `Sync Settings`, all files are replaced automatically once completed the download,
causing errors like infinite sublime text alerts when a dependency is not installed in your computer.

In this version, Sync Settings will use `Package Control` commands, to ensure the installation of your packages,
before to update `Preferences.sublime-settings` and `Package Control.sublime-settings` files.


Improvements:

- Add `unix shell style` for `excluded_files` and `included_files` options, using `fnmatch` library (wildcard).
- Improve error messages due to connection error, or insufficient token permissions.
- Delete custom logger by builtin logger
- Delete stylized popups by status bar messages
- Add ability to retrieve a gist without an access token
- Better documentation

Bug fixes:

- Exclude `SyncSettings.sublime-settings` on sync (https://github.com/mfuentesg/SyncSettings/issues/80)
- Fix files priority (https://github.com/mfuentesg/SyncSettings/issues/82)
- Colour scheme needs to load first (https://github.com/mfuentesg/SyncSettings/issues/90)
- Fix utf-8 error (https://github.com/mfuentesg/SyncSettings/issues/83)

Help me keep making awesome stuff.
