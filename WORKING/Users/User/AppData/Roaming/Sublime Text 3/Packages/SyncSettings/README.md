With [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings), you are able to synchronize your [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/) settings among multiple devices, and keep them updated.

Being powered by GitHub-Gists, [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings) provides you a reliable cross-platform solution to keep your backups secure.

Please, follow the steps below to getting started with [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings).

> [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings) works on Windows, Linux, macOS and [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3).


## Getting Started

1. Run `Package Control: Install Package` command, and looks for [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings)
2. Run `Sync Settings: Edit User Settings`
3. **if** *Do you already have a gist?*
    1. Copy `gist id` and put it in config file (`https://gist.github.com/<username>/<gist id>`) (`gist_id` property)
    2. Run `Sync Settings: Download` command to retrieve your backup.
4. **else**
    1. Create an access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with `gist` scope checked.
    2. Put the token in the config file (`access_token` property)
    3. Run `Sync Settings: Create and Upload` command
    
### File Format

Please note - the config file uses the JSON format. A simplified example may look like the following.

```
{
	"access_token": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
	"gist_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

## Options

By default this plugin operates over [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) packages folder (i.e `/Users/marcelo/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`), which means, `excluded_files` and `included_files` will looks for files inside that folder.

| name | type | description |
|---|---|---|
| `access_token`  | `string` | Brings write permission to [Sync Settings](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Sync%20Settings), over your gists (edit, delete and create). *(This option is not required, if you only want to download your backups)* | 
| `gist_id`  | `string` | Identifier of your backup on [gist.github.com](gist.github.com). |
| `auto_upgrade`  | `boolean` | If is `true`, your settings will be synced with the latest settings on [gist.github.com](gist.github.com) when [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) startup |
| `http_proxy`  | `string` | An HTTP proxy server to use for requests. |
| `https_proxy`  | `string` | An HTTPS proxy server to use for requests. |
| `excluded_files`  | `[]string` | In simple words, this option is a black list. Which means, every file that match with the defined pattern, will be ignored on sync. |
| `included_files`  | `[]string` | In simple words, this option is a white list. Which means, every file that match with the defined pattern, will be included on sync, even if it was included on `excluded_files` option. |

> Note: `excluded_files` and `included_files` are patterns defined as [unix shell style](http://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm).
