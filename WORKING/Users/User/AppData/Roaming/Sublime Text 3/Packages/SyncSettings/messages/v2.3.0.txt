Sync Settings v2.3.0

I am very excited to announce the new version of `Sync Settings`.
This version checks automagically if your ST has the latest version of your settings on startup.
You can set the `auto_upgrade` property to `true` and your settings will be upgraded on each startup.

* Check if your settings are up to date on startup
* Add PopUp support to ST Build 3070 or higher
* Auto upgrade your Settings if the auto_upgrade option is enabled
* auto_upgrade option was added
* Minor Enhancements
* MIT license was added
